# Searching-Algorithms-in-CPP

##**AIM**:To study about searching algorithms in C++

##**THEORY**:
<p>There are two main types of  searching algorithms that is used in C++:Linear search and Binary search.</p><br>

*Linear Search*:This is the most basic searching technique and is easier to implement too. In a linear search, the key to be searched is compared linearly with every element of the data collection. This technique works effectively on linear data structures. Linear search can be performed on any linear data structure having sorted or unsorted elements. But it takes a longer time if there are too many elements and if the key element is towards the end as each element is compared with the key(like indexing) value.<br>

*Binary Search*:Binary search is a technique that uses “divide and conquer” technique to search for a key. It works on a sorted linear list of elements. The sorted list is the basic requirement for a binary search to work.In the binary search method, the list is repeatedly divided into half and the key element is searched in both the halves of the list until the key is found.<br>
We repeatedly divide the array and by comparing the key element with the mid, we decide in which half to search for the key.<br>

Binary search is more efficient in terms of time and correctness. Linear search technique is seldom used as it is more slower. Binary search is a lot faster when compared to a linear search.<br>
The codes given in this repository explains how both the searching algorithms work.
